                    <h2>Work Philosophy</h2>
                    <div class="philosophy-quotes">
                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>I always start with problems. For example, when I first came to a company K., I immediately said: "Guys, you've got big problems. You're number two, you're clearly lagging behind, and you're operating in a market segment that is turning into a commodity." This means fierce competition.</p>
                            <p>At that time, the company K. was one of the market leaders and actively growing. Now, though, they're massively downsizing divisions one after another. Everything is happening exactly as I predicted: they're being pushed out by more agile and digital players who can build supply chains that are far more flexible thanks to technology.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <div class="quote-divider"></div>

                        <h3>Why Start with Problems</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>If a company doesn't acknowledge its problems, it's pointless to do anything.</p>
                            <p>For a company to recognize its problem, it needs to realize:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Current methods of doing business no longer work.</li>
                                <li>This applies to any area: production, management, client interactions, internal processes.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If a company says, "Everything's fine, just help improve the processes," it won't work. Only if the problem is acknowledged, then you can move forward and figure out where it really lies.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <div class="quote-divider"></div>

                        <h3>Why the Real Problem Is Hidden</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Often, the real problem isn't where the "sparks are flying." It's usually either higher or lower in the chain. It has to be uncovered. Here, I use approaches from the Russian school of philosophy, particularly the work of Georgy Shchedrovitsky, creator of the system-thinking methodology.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <div class="quote-divider"></div>

                        <h3>Framework 1: The Development Step</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Define the delta of change:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The step of change shouldn't be too big, or you'll lack resources, competencies, or time.</li>
                                <li>Consider time windows—they're not infinite.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Set the system boundaries:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Understand which system you're changing.</li>
                                <li>Define the success parameters and how they'll be measured.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If the boundaries aren't set, it creates the illusion that everything needs to be changed. But changing everything is impossible. You can change one piece, which then triggers changes elsewhere.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <div class="quote-divider"></div>

                        <h3>Framework 2: The Two Boxes</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Box 1: The company's activity that we're changing.</p>
                            <p>Box 2: Those impacted by the results of Box 1's activity.</p>
                            <p>Each box has its components:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>What is produced (outcome).</li>
                                <li>What is sold (product).</li>
                                <li>What is paid for (value proposition).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These three concepts are different. For instance, I may pay for a subscription, purchase storage space for code, but in reality, I'm being sold a cloud service.</p>

                        <h3>Example with Ore: Getting to the Core</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>When I was analyzing ore enrichment, we uncovered a technological limitation:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The grain size of the ore couldn't be reduced further without breaking the physics of the enrichment process.</li>
                                <li>Instead of discussing operational processes, we had to shift to fundamentally rethinking the chemical process.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Change isn't about improving quality by 3% or developing a slightly better product. It's about reaching a fundamentally new level that reshapes the market.</li>
                                <li>The step of change depends on the scale of the system.</li>
                                <li>Within a system, you need to analyze subsystems: digging deep enough to find the root problem but not so deep as to get lost.</li>
                                <li>Every system consists of organizational, technological, and entrepreneurial parts, governed by an institutional framework.</li>
